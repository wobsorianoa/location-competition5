CoreConfig001 - Set core-data MessageBus.Topics.SubscribeTopic not match device-virtual PublishTopicPrefix
    Given Run MQTT Subscriber Progress And Output  edgex/events/device/#
    And Set Test Variable  ${device_name}  messagebus-mqtt-core-2
    And Set MessageBus Topics/SubscribeTopic=edgex/events/custom/# For core-data On Consul
    And Create Device For device-virtual With Name ${device_name}
    When Get device data by device ${device_name} and command ${PREFIX}_GenerateDeviceValue_UINT8_RW with ds-pushevent=yes
    Then Should Return Status Code "200" And event
    And Event Has Been Recevied By MQTT Subscriber
