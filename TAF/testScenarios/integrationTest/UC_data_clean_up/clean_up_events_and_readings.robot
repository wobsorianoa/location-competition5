${SUITE}         Clean Up Events/Readings By Scheduler

*** Test Cases ***
Scheduler001-Set scheduler for each 30s to clean up events
    [Tags]  SmokeTest
    Given Create Device For device-virtual With Name set-scheduler-30s-device
    And Create Interval and set interval value to 30s
    And Create interval action with interval delete events for core-data
    And Create events by get device command
    When sleep  30s
    Then Query device events after exeucting deletion, and no event found
    [Teardown]  run keywords  Delete intervalAction by name ${intervalAction_name}
    ...                       AND  Delete interval by name ${interval_name}

Scheduler002-Set scheduler for each 60s to clean up events
    Given Create Device For device-virtual With Name set-scheduler-60s-device
    And Create Interval and set interval value to 60s
    And Create interval action with interval delete events for core-data
    And Create events by get device command

    General An IntervalAction Sample
    Set To Dictionary  ${intervalActions}[0][action]  intervalName=${interval_name}
    Set To Dictionary  ${intervalActions}[0][action][address]  host=edgex-core-data
    Set To Dictionary  ${intervalActions}[0][action][address]  path=${coreDataEventUri}/age/0
    Create intervalAction  ${intervalActions}
    Should Return Status Code "207"
    Item Index 0 Should Contain Status Code "201" And id

        ${random_command}  Get random "commandName" from "${data_type_skip_write_only}"

Query device events after exeucting deletion, and no event found
    Query all events
    should be equal as integers  ${response}  200
    ${events_length}=   GET LENGTH  ${content}[events]
    run keyword if  ${events_length} != 0  fail  Found events after executing deletion
