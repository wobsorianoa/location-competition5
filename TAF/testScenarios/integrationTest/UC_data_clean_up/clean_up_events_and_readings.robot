*** Test Cases ***
Scheduler001-Set scheduler for each 30s to clean up events
    [Tags]  SmokeTest
    Given Create Interval and set frequency to "30"s
    And Create interval action with interval "30"s delete events for core-data
    And Create events by get device command
    When sleep  30s
    Then Query device events after exeucting deletion, and no event found

    Given Create Interval and set frequency to "60"s
    And Create interval action with interval "60"s delete events for core-data
    And Create events by get device command
