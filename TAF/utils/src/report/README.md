Place below two python files in ../utils/src/report/ foldera.	mylistener.pyb.	samplereport.pyChanges in .robot file2.	Add  ${report} variable under variables section in .robot file*** Variables ***${report}                 ''3.	Add ${EdgeDetails} under each testcase${EdgeDetails} =  Create List  UUID1  Sensor1  Sensor_Hub1  Gateway1  Inputs1  Comments1  Reference14.	Pass the ${report} variable to all testcasesExample:a.	Sample: verify  ${report}b.	UC7.10 TC1: ${status} =  login  ${cfg_ethBT}  ${report}Changes in testcase.py python file5.	Change the signature of the test case function in python fileExample:a.	Sample:def verify(self, report):b.	UC7.10 TC1:def login(cfg, report):6.	Store the test details in testDetails variabletestDetails=["0","100","logs can be added here for additional details"] testDetails should have 3 values        1. Pass/Fail: 1/0        2. Accuracy: 100        3. Details: <Value is within the range>7.	Call report.recordDetail(testDetails)        try:report.recordDetail(testDetails) except AttributeError as e:           print(self.__class__.__name__ +"-"+str(e))   8.	      Next Steps:Discuss with team to modify the database model as required.
